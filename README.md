**HashBrown Maker** is a deterministic hash generator that creates reproducible, customizable hashes from a user-provided phrase and secret seed. 

## Features

- Deterministic: same phrase + seed always produces the same hash.  
- Configurable length and allowed character set.  
- Enforce mandatory character types: lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols.  
- Retro “techy brown” interface inspired by classic computing aesthetics.  
- Deterministic fallback ensures all required character types are included.  

## Usage

1. Enter a unique phrase to generate a HashBrown.  
2. Set your secret seed (keep it safe!).  
3. Adjust desired hash length.  
4. Define allowed characters and select required character types.  
5. Copy your HashBrown.  

> **Note:** The algorithm is deterministic but not reversible. Your seed and phrase must be remembered to reproduce the same HashBrown.
